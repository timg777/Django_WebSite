# Django_WebSite

 Simple Django project
 
 This project can add new user to your DataBase, also can add news and another articles
 
 But there are no beautiful pages, beacuse it is template project
 
 It helps you to learn better this Framework and gives attempts to create first WebSite on your own

 Connent project to your DataBase in Django/TestPro/settings.py
